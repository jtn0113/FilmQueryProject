# FilmQueryProject

## Description
FilmQueryProject is an application that allows you to search the film database by either a film ID, or a keyword.
When you launch the app, you will be presented a menu with 3 options:
1. Look up film by its ID
2. Look up a film by a search keyword
3. Exit

Option 1 will prompt you to enter the ID for the film you would like to search for. If a match is found, the film details will be shown.

Option 2 will prompt you to enter a keyword. The films title and description will be searched for a match of the keyword. If matches are found, the film details of each film will be shown.

Option 3 will exit the program.
